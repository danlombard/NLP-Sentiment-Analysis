# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to delve into the some applications of NLPs. The dataset subject to this project contains tweets where the majority is of a very negative nature and the goal is to uncover whether a machine learning application could be used to predict whether a ceratin statement was explicitly 'Negative' or 'Not negative'. 

The model was initially fitted to a Gaussian Naive Bayes model but it was found that it was poor in making accurate predictions of whether a statement was 'Not negative'. The model was then fitted to a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, and there was a significant increase in the performance of the model in both predicting 'Negative' and Not negative' statements. 

It is desireable to investigate further applications of of solving NLP problems with the use of deep learning ANN.
